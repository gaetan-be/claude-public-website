                        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>It started with a group chat message: "Who's up for Padel this Sunday?" Within minutes, four friends had locked in. The court was booked, the rivalry was set, and the stakes were bragging rights for the entire year.</p>

                        <h3>The Warm-Up</h3>
                        <p>We arrived at 10 AM, rackets in hand, energy drinks ready. The morning sun lit up the glass-walled court as we stretched and practiced our serves. The air was crisp, perfect for an intense match.</p>

                        <h3>Game On</h3>
                        <p>Three sets of pure adrenaline. Smashes off the glass, impossible returns, and rallies that seemed to last forever. Every point was fought for like it was match point.</p>
